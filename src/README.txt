ESS Simulation

------------------
Running Simulation
------------------
Running the program in java requires compiling the code
and running the executable (Goto section if you don't know how)
with 1 mandatory arguments and 3 other
optional arguments.

First Argument = [Population of Birds]
Second Argument = {Optional}[Percentage of Hawks]
Third Argument = {Optional}[Resource Amount]
Fourth Argument = {Optional}[Hawk v Hawk Interaction Loss]

The mandatory argument is the population without otherwise the simulation cannot
run. If you don't input anything for the other arguments the program will use the
built in default values.
